## Linking the virtual NPM package 'lizard-api-client'.
##
## Although imports from the lizard-api-client succeed, Sublime sees it as
## an empty folder in it's filebrowser; this is odd, mostly because Sublime
## sees it as a normal, filled folder when when using its filebrowser for our
## G4AW app. The way the linking now (25-08-2017) took place:

$ npm link lizard-api-client

/home/dirk/Projects/crop-growth-project/crop-growth-app/node_modules/lizard-api-client ->
/home/dirk/.node_modules_global/lib/node_modules/lizard-api-client ->
/home/dirk/Projects/crop-growth-project/lizard-api-client
